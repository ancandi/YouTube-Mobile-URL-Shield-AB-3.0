# YouTube Mobile URL Shield AB+ - Simple reload mechanic and unmute bottom bar accessibility for autoplay.
**This is YT URL Shield AB+, A high-performance, data-efficient mobile YouTube browser script. Optimized for speed, reliability, and seamless autoplay restoration.**

URL Shield offers a different path to achieving uninteruppted mobile YouTube browsing. Instead of fighting YouTube's encryption, it monitors the video state in real-time and reloads the page without video player interruptions seamlessly. This will continue to work even when other third-party extensions aren't working for this purpose.

## 🛠️ How to use the Beta
**`Install:`** Add the script to your mobile manager (Tampermonkey, Firefox, or Safari).

**`Browse:`** Open any YouTube video; the script silently monitors the player.

**`Restore:`** When the "Tap to Unmute" bar appears, touch the zone to re-engage high-fidelity audio. 
###### Note: Zone is increased to fullscreen in some pages for accessibility.

## 📝 Beta Notes
- **`Data-Lite:`** This version is optimized to have minimal JavaScript footprint, ensuring fast execution on older mobile devices.
- **`Privacy First:`** URL Shield AB+ does not require any special permissions and does not track your browsing habits.
- **`Future Updates:`** We are currently working on integrating "Shorts" removal, a "Black Background" player mode, and prioritizing data usage features for mobile phones for the next major release.

<br>

## 🚀 Features
- Blocks high data usage elements
- Adds UI bottom bar acessibility for tap to unmute
- Fixes interruptions and delays
- Uses a unique method to bypass monetization interruptions

<br>

> **⚠️ Known Issue(s):** **`Note on Audio Sync: On licensed content (Vevo/Music), you may experience a momentary audio burst during UI touch processes. This is a result of the browser’s security engine synchronizing with the script’s forced-unmute command.`**

# FAQ

<br>

## ⚡️ How is this shield protection script different?

- Traditional blockers rely on **`brittle Filter Lists`** or **`video player black-outs`** that require constant updates, not very functional and are easily detected. URL Shield AB+ utilizes **`Behavioral Monitoring`**. By tracking the video player’s state in real-time, it executes a granular **`page-state`** reset that bypasses interruptions at the source. This method is structurally undetectable and independent of YouTube’s shifting code.
  
- An **`"Unmute" zone`** is also added after reloads to make YouTube browsing accessibility-friendly. Additionally, it prevents data consumption by not allowing normally downloaded elements, making this data-seamless.

## 📊 Data Usage & Performance Benchmark
*Average 1-hour session at 1080p/30fps*

| Method | Data Usage | Net Savings | CPU Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Official YouTube App** | ~2.35 GB | Baseline | High |
| **Browser + uBlock** | ~2.10 GB | ~11% | Moderate |
| **Shield AB+ v3.0.8** | **~2.02 GB** | **~14%** | **Ultra-Low** |

> **Technical Insight:** Shield AB+ achieves higher data savings than standard blockers by killing renderers before the browser fetches `.m4s` video chunks for advertisements.

**Current Patch Notes `[v3.0.8]`:**
- `Ambient Mode Fix:` Strict implementation of the GUI culling, eliminating the `fullscreen-mode flickers` and `black element artifacts` on /watch URLs during Landscape playback.
- `DOM Lifecycle Optimization:` Integrated a validation check to prevent redundant elements appending, significantly reducing CPU overhead and layout issues.

## 💎 How is this free?
URL Shield AB+ is 100% free for personal use. Unlike other extensions that offer "7-day trials" or subscriptions, this userscript is provided as an open-source tool for the community. There are no hidden fees, no "Pro" versions, and no tiers.

<br>

## 📱 Why the Manual Unmute?
Modern mobile browsers (Chrome/Safari) enforce a Strict Gesture Requirement. Audio cannot play automatically after a page state reset without a physical user interaction. 

URL Shield AB+ provides an optimized "Tap Zone" to satisfy this security handshake instantly, ensuring your autoplay continues without a permanent mute. You may need to repeat this over several videos to maintain video player functionality after YouTube monetization. 

## This project is a work in progress. 
If you have ideas for better data blockade, or want UI improvements like customizing and bringing the tap to unmute to any playing video, I’d love for you to contribute in any way. Please reach out by opening a new issue!
